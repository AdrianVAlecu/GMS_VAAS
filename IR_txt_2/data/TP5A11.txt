                     Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are securities whose
                     principal is tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The principal
                     increases with inflation and decreases with deflation. When the
                     security matures, the U.S. Treasury pays the original or adjusted
                     principal, whichever is greater.

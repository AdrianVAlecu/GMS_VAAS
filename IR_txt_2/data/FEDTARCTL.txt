Notes:               The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the
                     midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal
                     funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal
                     funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the
                     longer run. Each participant's projections are based on his or her
                     assessment of appropriate monetary policy. The range for each variable
                     in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to
                     highest, for that variable in the given year; the central tendencies
                     exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each year.
                     This series represents the low value of the central tendency forecast
                     established by the Federal Open Market Committee.
